What challenges did you face installing Android Studio?
During the installation of Android Studio, I encountered several challenges, mainly because the setup took a long time due to the large SDK and emulator files that needed to be downloaded.
I also experienced an issue with a missing Java SDK, which caused errors when trying to run the program. To fix this, I learned how to configure the correct JDK path in Android Studio’s settings, and after doing so, everything started working smoothly.

What did you learn about Android app structure?
Through this activity, I learned that an Android app is composed of several key components. The Java or Kotlin files handle the app’s logic and functionality, while the XML files define its layout and visual design. Additionally, 
the Manifest file contains important information about the app, such as its permissions and configurations. 
Understanding how these parts work together helped me see how Android applications are structured and how design and logic combine to create a fully functional mobile app.
